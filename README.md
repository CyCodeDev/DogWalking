# DogWalking
Mock Schema and data for Dog-walking

This schema involves the idea of having the following tables:

OwnerAccounts: A list of unique accounts created by dog owners

WalkerAccounts: A list of unique accounts created by dog walkers

DogsRegistered: A list of all dogs registered (i.e. have a photo and are ready to walk)

OwnerAccountsToDogs: A list of Owners-to-Dogs associations

DogWalksLog: A list of all of the walks performed


This data meant for querying within Cloud Compute, using PostgreSQL.
